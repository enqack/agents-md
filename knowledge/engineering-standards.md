# Software Engineering Standards

This document establishes the baseline quality expectations for all code generated by agents.

## 1. Code Quality Principles

### SOLID
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One module, one reason to change.
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification.
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types.
- **I**nterface Segregation: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose one.
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

### Clean Code
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Abstract common logic.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid over-engineering.
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: Do not implement features "just in case".

## 2. Documentation

### In-Code
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Variable names should explain *what* they are. Comments should explain *why* the code exists.
- **Public API**: All exported functions/classes must have docstrings (GoDoc, JSDoc, Docstring).

### Project Level
- **README.md**: Every project must have a README explaining:
  - Purpose
  - Installation
  - Usage
  - Contributing

## 3. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test logic in isolation. High coverage required for core logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions (DB, API).
- **E2E Tests**: Test critical user journeys.
- **Test Doubles**: Use mocks/stubs for external dependencies to keep unit tests fast.
